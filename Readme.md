Hedgehog Lab DevOps Task

This repository demonstrates a full-stack containerized web application using DevOps best practices with CI/CD, Docker, Terraform, and Azure. The solution includes a three-tier architecture, where the frontend communicates with the backend, and updates are persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

ðŸ§± Architecture
The application is structured into three primary components:

Frontend (React): Deployed to Azure Static Web Apps

Backend (FastAPI): Containerized and deployed to Azure App Service via GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

Database (PostgreSQL): Managed by Azure Flexible Server

Infrastructure: Provisioned using Terraform for a consistent, repeatable setup

âœ… Requirements Checklist
1. Frontend - React Application (ID: REQ-FRONTEND)
âœ… Frontend is a React application.

âœ… The application is deployed to Azure Static Web Apps.

âœ… API communication with the backend is handled via environment variables.

2. Backend - FastAPI (ID: REQ-BACKEND)
âœ… The backend is implemented with FastAPI.

âœ… The backend is containerized and deployed to Azure App Service.

âœ… The Docker image for the backend is pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and pulled by Azure App Service.

âœ… The backend communicates with the PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

3. Database - PostgreSQL (ID: REQ-DB)
âœ… A PostgreSQL database is used.

âœ… The database is managed by Azure Flexible Server.

âœ… Data persistence is ensured using Docker volumes in development and managed databases in production.

4. Infrastructure as Code - Terraform (ID: REQ-IAC)
âœ… The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.

âœ… Terraform files are located in the infra/ folder.

âœ… Provisioning and destruction of resources are handled with terraform apply and terraform destroy.

5. CI/CD (ID: REQ-CICD)
âœ… Frontend: Automatically deployed via GitHub Actions on every push to the main branch.

âœ… Backend: The backend Docker image is built and pushed to GHCR using GitHub Actions. Azure App Service pulls the latest image from GHCR.

âœ… CI/CD workflows are automated, reducing manual intervention.
